        <p>My name is <b><i>JARIN</i></b> and I love to watch k-dramas.<br>As I am a student,
             so I am not able to watch so many k-dramas.<br> Here are some dramas that I was able to watch.

        <p>It was my first k-drama. I really loved the story, the cinematography was incredible.<br>
        And the most remarkable thing was the OST. Seriously, I would never feel tired of listening<br>
        to them.
